# BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Simulator

## About the Project
This project is a simple implementation of Quantum Key Distribution using the BB84 protocol.
It helps in understanding how secure key exchange is possible using quantum concepts.

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- PennyLane
- Google Colab

## How to Run
1. Open the Google Colab link provided below.
2. Run the first cell to install required libraries.
3. Run all remaining cells one by one.
4. Enter the number of bits when asked.
5. Observe the output and generated secret key.

## Deployment
The project is deployed using Google Colab.
The simulation can be executed directly from the shared Colab notebook.

## Project Link
- Google Colab Link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11WODVEd9EAjdJ1x3TfpVujVQJoUBGxGX?usp=sharing

## Output
The output displays:
- Sender bits and bases
- Receiver bases and measured bits
- Matching bases count
- Final secret key

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how BB84 protocol works for secure key generation.
Only the bits with matching bases are used, which ensures secure communication.
